# DSA-Assignment
Salford University Year 2 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms.

For this assignment, I had to create my own implementation of a Linked Stack (using anything by primative data types was not allowed) in Java to create a command line application that takes Infix expressions and outputs the equivalent postfix expression.

For example, an input of (P\*Q)+(R/(S*(T/U))) would result in an output of PQ\*RSTU/*/+

The writeup that accompanied the created application has also been uploaded to this repo.
